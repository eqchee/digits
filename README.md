# Convolutional Neural Network to Recognise Digits



## About The Project

Deep Learning was performed by creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to identify handwritten digits on images. This was achieved by preparing the data and then performing CNN modelling and evaluation. An accuracy of 98.8% was achieved when the predictions were submitted to Kaggle.

# Convolutional Neural Network to Recognise Digits



## About The Project

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was created to recognise handwritten digits on images. This was achieved by preparing the data and then performing CNN modelling and evaluation. An accuracy of 98.8% was achieved when the predictions were submitted to Kaggle.
